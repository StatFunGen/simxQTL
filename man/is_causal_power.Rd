\title{Identify Causal SNPs Based on Statistical Power}
\usage{
is_causal_power(G, beta, residual_variance, power = 0.8)
}
\arguments{
\item{G}{Genotype matrix (samples Ã— SNPs).}

\item{beta}{Vector of true effect sizes for each SNP.}

\item{residual_variance}{Residual (error) variance.}

\item{power}{Minimum power threshold for a SNP to be considered causal (default 0.80).}
}
\value{
A vector of indices corresponding to SNPs with power >= threshold.
}
\description{
This function identifies SNPs that have sufficient statistical power to be
detected as causal. Power is calculated based on the non-centrality parameter
of a chi-square test, considering sample size, effect size, and SNP variance.
}
\details{
The function calculates power using a non-central chi-square distribution
  with non-centrality parameter NCP = n * beta^2 * var(X) / residual_variance, where the
  significance threshold is Bonferroni-corrected (alpha = 0.05 / p).
